ðŸŒ¿ Smart Greenhouse Ventilation Optimization
ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
This project builds a nonlinear optimization model for smart greenhouse ventilation control. The goal is to minimize electricity cost while maintaining optimal temperature conditions for crop growth over a 48-hour period. A multi-objective approach is used to balance energy consumption and temperature deviation.

ðŸ§  Key Objectives
Minimize ventilation cost by adjusting the hourly air exchange rate.

Maintain ideal greenhouse temperature close to a target value.

Explore tradeoffs between electricity cost and temperature deviation.

Evaluate solver performance using a variety of nonlinear optimization solvers.

ðŸ”§ Methodology
Nonlinear cost function: Ventilation cost is modeled as a cubic function of airflow rate.

Temperature dynamics: Indoor temperature evolves hourly based on the previous temperature and outdoor temperature, influenced by the ventilation rate.

Constraints:

Indoor temperature must stay within allowable bounds.

Ventilation rate is bounded between 0% and 100%.

ðŸ“Š Optimization Tasks
Task 1 - Cost Minimization
Objective: Minimize electricity cost
Result: Optimal strategy ventilates only between hour 11-15; cost â‰ˆ Â£90.61

Task 2 - Temperature Deviation Minimization
Objective: Minimize deviation from 27Â°C target
Result: 100% ventilation in early hours; cost â†‘ to Â£1607.5

Task 3 - Tradeoff Optimization
Objective: Minimize weighted sum of cost and temperature deviation
Result: A balanced penalty (Î» = 1.0) yields cost â‰ˆ Â£157.7, deviation â‰ˆ 4.02

Task 4 - Solver Comparison
Tested solvers: BARON, CONOPT, KNITRO, SNOPT, OCTERACT, etc.
Best performance: CONOPT and KNITRO (fastest & accurate)

ðŸ§ª Tools and Languages
Python & AMPL modeling

Solvers: CONOPT, KNITRO, BARON via NEOS Server

ðŸ§­ Recommendations
Incorporate sunlight heat gain and heat loss for more realistic modeling.

Extend model with robustness for power failures or weather extremes.

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of nonlinear optimization in smart agriculture. By tuning ventilation rates intelligently, energy consumption can be reduced significantly while maintaining crop-friendly temperatures.
